# Weather App

## Description

The Weather App is a simple Flask web application that allows users to check the current weather in a city. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it alongside a background image that reflects the current weather condition. The application provides a visually appealing and informative way to stay updated on weather conditions.

## How It Works

- **Homepage**: The user is initially presented with a search box on the homepage. They can enter the name of a city and submit the form.

- **Weather Information**: Upon submitting the form, the application fetches the weather information for the entered city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The weather details, including temperature, weather type, and min/max temperature, are displayed.

- **Background Image**: The background image of the page changes dynamically based on the weather type. For instance, a clear sky will have a different background image compared to a rainy or cloudy sky.

### How to Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to access the Weather Application.

The output of the program will look like this:
