# Weather App

## Description

The Weather App is a simple Flask web application that allows users to check the current weather in a city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it alongside a background image that reflects the current weather condition.

## How It Works

- The Flask application is initialized and configured with a secret key.

- The OpenWeatherMap API key and base URL are defined as constants.

- Routes are established for the home page (`/`) and weather retrieval (`/weather`). The routes render HTML templates, allowing users to input cities and view weather information.

- Functions such as `fetch_weather` and `get_weather_image_url` handle the retrieval of weather data and mapping of weather types to image URLs.

## How to Run the Application

- Make sure you have a valid OpenWeatherMap API key.
- To run this application, make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Ensure that Flask is installed. If not, you can install it using pip: `pip install flask`
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the application in the terminal: `python3 app.py`
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view access the Weather App.
- Use the search bar to look for specific movies.

The output will look like this:
